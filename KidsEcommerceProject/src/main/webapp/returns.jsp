            <h2><strong>Returns Policy</strong></h2>
            <p>
                At KidsShop, we want you to be completely satisfied with your purchases. If for any reason you are not happy with your order, we offer a straightforward returns policy to ensure a hassle-free experience.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Return Eligibility</strong></h3>
            <p>
                To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused, unworn, and in the same condition as received. It must also be in the original packaging with all tags attached. Certain items, such as personalized products or perishable goods, may not be eligible for return.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Return Process</strong></h3>
            <p>
                If you wish to return an item, please contact our customer service team within 30 days of purchase. You will be provided with a return authorization and instructions on how to proceed. Shipping costs for returns may be the responsibility of the customer unless the return is due to our error.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Refunds</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Once your return is received and inspected, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, your refund will be processed and credited to the original method of payment within a certain number of days, depending on your card issuer's policies.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Exchanges</strong></h3>
            <p>
                If you need to exchange an item for a different size, color, or style, please contact us to arrange the exchange. We will guide you through the process and assist in ensuring you receive the desired product.
